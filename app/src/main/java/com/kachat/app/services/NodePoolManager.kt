/**
 * Real gRPC-backed Kaspa node pool: probes seed/discovered/manual nodes over the
 * actual `protowire.RPC` MessageStream (GetInfo/GetBlockDagInfo/GetPeerAddresses),
 * replacing the previous fake always-healthy simulation.
 *
 * Scoped deliberately simpler than the full POOLS_v2.md architecture (no EWMA
 * scoring, no network-epoch tracking, no hedged requests — see the "explicit
 * non-goals" section of the implementation plan): this drives a status *display*,
 * not a live routing decision under load.
 *
 * If the user pins a "host:port" node in Connection Settings
 * ([AppSettingsRepository.trustedNodeAddress]), this switches to a Kaspium-style
 * fixed-node mode instead: all discovery (seeds/DNS/peer-gossip) stops, and every
 * connection this class hands out is that one address, with no automatic failover
 * to a different node if it goes down (see [trustedNodeAddress]'s doc comment).
